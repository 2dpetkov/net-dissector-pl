Most of these tests need to bypass the TCP/IP stack in order to directly 
open the network interface, which generally requires administrative 
privileges or appropriate access rights. The tests are skipped if the 
user account running these does not have the required rights. 

Note that some of these tests require a working network interface with
actual traffic on it.  For example the loop test waits for 10 packets
to be received on the network before exiting.  If there is no traffic
on the interface, this test will block.

The memory leak tests do not complete.
