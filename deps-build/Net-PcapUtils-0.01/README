README for Net::PcapUtils 0.01
==============================

This module provides some code to abstract away some of the messier
parts of using the Net::Pcap library.  The idea is to be able to write
"one-liner" type scripts for packet capture without getting bogged
down in the initialisation code.  This makes it possible to write very
compact Perl scripts involving packet capture.

To use Net::PcapUtils, the latest version of the Net::Pcap module is
required (at the time of writing, this was version 0.03).

Net::PcapUtils provides three functions that are described below:

	- Net::PcapUtils::loop(\&callback_fn, [optional args]);

		Capture packets and execute callback function for evey
		packet received.

	- Net::PcapUtils::next($pcap_t);

		Return the next packet and packet header from an open
 		network interface.

	- Net::PcapUtils::open([optional args]);

		Open a network interface for packet capture and return
		a packet capture descriptor.

If none of the optional arguments are declared, then a reasonable set
of defaults are assumed.  See the Net::PcapUtils manpage for more
details.

I hope you enjoy Net::PcapUtils.
