  - Fix META.yml info on upstream.

5.71  Sat Nov 20 01:20 2010

    Use "lvalue" attribute for testing since "locked"
    is deprecated.

  - Merge trivial test change from core that was done
    as part of the lib-to-ext migration.

5.67  Tue Sep 12 16:50 2008
  - Added a test case for the bug that was fixed in 5.66_01,
    courtesy of Christoph Lamprecht.

5.66_01  Tue Sep  2 14:40 2008
  - Fix determination of the autosplit.ix in ugly edge cases.
    Explanation:
    If the module file isn't called $Foo.pm, but
    something random, then the static substitution which
    tries to determine the location of autosplit.ix fails.
    Up until now, the substitution would fail, so AutoLoader
    evaluated the module code again instead of falling back
    searching the autosplit.ix in @INC. The code was there
    but not triggered in some circumstances.
    For an example error in a PAR context, run
     pp --clean -e 'use Storable; retrieve("foo")'
    and then ./a.out and which it explode.

5.66  Wed May 14 18:29 2008
  - Fix broken distribution.

5.65  Tue May 13 11:53 2008

  - Include AutoSplit in the distribution.

5.63  Mon Jan 17 14:17 2007
  - Adding INSTALLDIRS => 'perl' to Makefile.PL

5.62  Mon Jan 15 15:13 2007
  - First release to CPAN. Previously available in core perl.
  - Fixes an obscure bug in 5.61/5.60 which would result in infinite
    recursion if a module's %INC element is changed to a different
    file name and AutoLoader's AUTOLOAD is used by the module.
    (This can happen with PAR.)
